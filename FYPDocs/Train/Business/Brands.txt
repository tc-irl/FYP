The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines a brand as a name, term, sign, symbol or design, or a combination of them intended to identify the goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of other sellers.
To succeed in branding you must understand the needs and wants of your customers and prospects. You do this by integrating your brand strategies through your company at every point of public contact.

Branding is used in businesses and organizations of all sizes and types. Branding is intended to identify goods or services and deliver the message that a particular organization, business, or product is the only one that can suit customers' needs.
