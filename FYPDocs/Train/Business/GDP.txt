GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis. It includes all of private and public consumption, government outlays, investments and exports less imports that occur within a defined territory.
GDP is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country, as well as to gauge a country's standard of living.
