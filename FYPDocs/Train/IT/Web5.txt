A rich Internet application (RIA) is a Web application designed to deliver the same features and functions normally associated with deskop applications. RIAs generally split the processing across the Internet/network divide by locating the user interface and related activity and capability on the client side, and the data manipulation and operation on the application server side.
An RIA normally runs inside a Web browser and usually does not require software installation on the client side to work. However, some RIAs may only work properly with one or more specific browsers.
