Sometimes abbreviated as S/W, software is a collection of instructions that enable a user to interact with the computer or have the computer perform specific tasks for them. Without software, the computer would be useless. For example, without your Internet browser software you would be unable to browse the Internet or read this page and without a software operating system the browser would not be able to run on your computer.
