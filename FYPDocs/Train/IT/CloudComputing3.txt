There are three types of cloud providers that you can subscribe to: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). These three types differ in the amount of control that you have over your information, and conversely, how much you can expect your provider to do for you. Briefly, here is what you can expect from each type.
Software As A Service - A SAAS provider gives subscribers access to both resources and applications. SaaS makes it unnecessary for you to have a physical copy of software to install on your devices. SaaS also makes it easier to have the same software on all of your devices at once by accessing it on the cloud. In a SAAS agreement, you have the least control over the cloud. Platform As A Service - A PAAS system goes a level above the Software as a Service setup. A PAAS provider gives subscribers access to the components that they require to develop and operate applications over the internet.
Infrastructure As A Service - An IaaS agreement, as the name states, deals primarily with computational infrastructure. In an IaaS agreement, the subscriber completely outsources the storage and resources, such as hardware and software, that they need.
As you go down the list from number one to number three, the subscriber gains more control over what they can do within the space of the cloud. The cloud provider has less control in an IaaS system than with an SaaS agreement.
What does this mean for the home user or business looking to start using the cloud? It means you can choose your level of control over your information and types of services that you want from a cloud provider.
