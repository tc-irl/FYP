A smartphone is a mobile phone built on a mobile operating system, with more advanced computing capability and connectivity than a feature phone.
The first smartphones combined the functions of a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a mobile phone. Later models added the functionality of portable media players, low-end compact digital cameras, pocket video cameras, and GPS navigation units to form one multi-use device. Modern smartphones also include high-resolution touchscreens and web browsers that display standard web pages as well as mobile-optimized sites. High-speed data access is provided by Wi-Fi and Mobile Broadband.
The most common mobile operating systems (OS) used by modern smartphones include Google Android, Apple iOS, Nokia Symbian, RIM BlackBerry OS, Samsungs Bada and Microsoft Windows Phone.

Some mobile manufacturers include:

Nokia
Samsung
Sony
IPhone
LG
