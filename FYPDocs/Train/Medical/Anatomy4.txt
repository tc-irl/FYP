The liver is the largest glandular organ in the body and performs many vital functions to keep the body pure of toxins and harmful substances.
The liver is considered a gland—an organ that secretes chemicals—because it produces bile, a substance needed to digest fats. Bile’s salts break up fat into smaller pieces so it can be absorbed more easily in the small intestine

The liver also: 
Detoxifies the blood to rid it of harmful substances such as alcohol and drugs
Stores some vitamins and iron
Stores the simple sugar glucose
Converts stored sugar to usable sugar when the body’s sugar (glucose) levels fall below normal.
Breaks down hemoglobin as well as insulin and other hormones
Converts ammonia to urea, which is vital in metabolism
Destroys old red blood cells
