A tendon is a fibrous connective tissue which attaches muscle to bone. Tendons may also attach muscles to structures such as the eyeball. A tendon serves to move the bone or structure. An example of a tendon is the Achilles Tendon which connects the calf muscle or gastrocnemius to the heel. Another example, quadriceps tendon, which connects the front thigh muscles to the kneecap (patella). 
A ligament is a fibrous connective tissue which attaches bone to bone, and usually serves to hold structures together and keep them stable. 
In joints, there are two types: capsular and noncapsular. Capsular ligaments are simply thickenings of the fibrous capsule itself, taking the form of either elongated bands or triangles the fibers of which radiate from a small area of one articulating bone to a line upon its mating fellow. The iliofemoral ligament of the hip joint is an example of a triangular ligament. Capsular ligaments are found on the outer surface of the capsule. There is one exception to this rule: ligaments of the shoulder joint (glenohumeral ligaments) are found on the inner surface.
Noncapsular ligaments are free from the capsule and are of two kinds, internal and external. Examples are the outer (fibular) ligament of the knee, which passes from the femur to the upper part of the fibula over both the knee and tibiofibular joints, and the middle part of the outer ligament of the ankle joint, which passes from the lowest part of the fibula to the heel bone
