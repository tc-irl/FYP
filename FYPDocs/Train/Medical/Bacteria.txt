Bacteria are microorganisms too small to see with the naked eye that exist in virtually all environments in the world. 
Bacteria are tiny, one-celled creatures that get nutrients from their environments in order to live. In some cases that environment is a human body. Bacteria can reproduce outside of the body or within the body as they cause infections. Some infections bacteria cause include sore throats (tonsillitis or strep throat), ear infections, cavities, and pneumonia (say: new-MO-nyuh).

But not all bacteria are bad. For example, some bacteria are also used by scientists in labs to produce medicines and vaccines.
